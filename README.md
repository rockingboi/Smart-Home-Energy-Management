# Smart Home Energy Management Using ML Algo
### 🏠 Smart Home IoT: Load Forecasting with EDA, ARIMA & LSTM

This repository contains a self-learning project focused on **predicting smart home energy load** using various time series modeling techniques, including **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **ARIMA**, and **LSTM**.

### 📌 Project Overview

With the increasing penetration of IoT devices in smart homes, energy consumption data from appliances can be used to predict future load and optimize energy usage. This project uses time series data of household appliance usage and builds models to forecast electrical load.

## 📊 Features

- Time Series Forecasting with:
  - 📈 **ARIMA** (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average)
  - 🔁 **LSTM** (Long Short-Term Memory networks)
- 📉 Data pre-processing and transformation for time series modeling
- 🧪 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** for visual and statistical insights
- ✅ Model training, evaluation, and saving using Python
